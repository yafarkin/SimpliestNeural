Simply neural network with samples

I created these simple basic projects to explore how neural networks are organized and work.
The code from the project https://github.com/ArtemOnigiri/SimpleNN helped a lot in understanding how it works.
The project is written in C# and contains:
1. Perceptron class.
2. Several activation functions.
3. A neural network engine to perform computation and training methods.
4. Several examples of the network: project with points, Iris and numbers from mnist set.
